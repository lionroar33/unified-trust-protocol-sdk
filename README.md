Executive Summary: Unified Trust Protocol (UTP)
1. Vision Statement
Ethereum has EAS. Optimism has Gitcoin Passport. Solana—the highest-performance chain for global payments—is missing this "Middle Layer" of Trust. Eons Soft Tech is building it.
The Unified Trust Protocol (UTP) is an open-source "Trust-as-a-Service" SDK designed specifically for the Solana PayFi ecosystem. We provide a lightweight, privacy-preserving gateway to verify unique human users, eliminating Sybil attacks and identity fraud without the friction of traditional KYC.
2. Industry Benchmarks: Why UTP?
We have benchmarked UTP against global standards to ensure it is "Solana-Native" and 10x more efficient for local dApps:
•	The "Gitcoin Passport" for Solana: Like Gitcoin, we aggregate "Trust Stamps" (domain aging, on-chain activity). However, UTP is built natively for Solana’s speed, providing instant verification for PayFi applications.
•	The "EAS" (Ethereum Attestation Service) Bridge: Solana currently lacks a universal on-chain attestation standard. UTP introduces a programmable layer where dApps can issue and verify "Humanity Attestations" seamlessly.
•	The Lightweight "Civic" Alternative: While Civic focuses on heavy, permissioned enterprise KYC, UTP is a permissionless, lightweight reputation score. It is designed for the average DeFi user who needs privacy and speed over institutional-grade identity.
3. Core Technical Innovation (Phase 1 POC)
Our Proof of Concept focuses on three "High-Signal" technical pillars:
•	ZK-Email Validation: Leveraging Zero-Knowledge proofs (Circom/SnarkJS) to verify that a user owns an aged, reputable email domain without ever revealing the email address itself.
•	Biometric Liveness: A mobile-first integration via the Solana Mobile Stack (SMS). We use native device sensors for 3D face-matching to ensure the user is a real, live human in real-time.
•	"Burn-to-Validate" Model: To ensure Sybil-resistance, users must burn a micro-amount of SOL/Tokens to mint their unique "Trust-Hash" on-chain, creating a deflationary economic barrier for bot farms.
4. Impact & Public Good
As an Ahmedabad-based agency, Eons Soft Tech is committed to the "Public Good" nature of this project:
•	Open Source: The entire SDK, Anchor programs (Rust), and ZK-circuits will be public and MIT-licensed.
•	Ecosystem Growth: UTP enables the next generation of Solana "Airdrop-Safe" protocols and fraud-free merchant payment rails.

1. Universal Benchmarking Table (The Comparison)
This table should be prominently featured on the landing page to show how Unified Trust Protocol (UTP) occupies the "Golden Middle" of the identity landscape.

| Feature        | Gitcoin Passport        | Civic              | UTP (Eons Soft Tech)              |
|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Ecosystem      | Ethereum / EVM          | Solana             | **Solana (Native)**               |
| Verification   | Aggregated Stamps       | Manual KYC         | **ZK-Email + Biometrics**          |
| User Privacy   | High (off-chain)        | Low (PII stored)   | **Maximum (ZK-Proofs)**            |
| Integration    | Heavy SDK               | Permissioned API   | **Lightweight SDK (T+0)**          |
| Bot Barrier    | Social Scoring          | Centralized        | **Burn-to-Validate (On-chain)**   |


3. Technical Architecture & Component Stack
The UTP is built on a modular three-layer stack designed for sub-second finality.
Layer 1: The Privacy Engine (ZK-Email)
•	Tech: Circom + SnarkJS.
•	Spec: We generate Zero-Knowledge proofs that verify a user’s DKIM signature from an aged email domain (e.g., @google.com). This proves the account is legitimate and "aged" without revealing the actual email address to the merchant.
Layer 2: The Liveness Oracle (Biometrics)
•	Tech: Solana Mobile Stack (SMS) + Native Device API.
•	Spec: Direct integration with iOS/Android Secure Enclave. We perform a real-time face-liveness check to ensure a "Proof-of-Personhood," preventing AI-deepfake or bot-farm registrations.
Layer 3: The Trust Registry (On-Chain)
•	Tech: Rust + Anchor Framework.
•	Spec: A decentralized registry using Program Derived Addresses (PDAs).
•	The "Burn-to-Validate" Logic: To prevent Sybil spam, users must burn a micro-amount of SOL (0.001 SOL) to mint their unique "Trust Hash" on-chain. This creates an economic cost for attackers that far outweighs any bot-driven reward.

4. The "Solana-Native" Advantage
Reviewers need to know why this must be on Solana:
•	Parallel Execution: UTP uses Solana’s Sealevel runtime to verify thousands of identity attestations simultaneously.
•	Sub-Cent Fees: Verification costs remain under $0.0001, making it viable for high-volume micro-payments (PayFi).
•	Direct-to-Wallet: No separate account needed. The "Trust Score" is an attestation directly tied to the user's Solana wallet address.
