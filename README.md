Executive Summary: Unified Trust Protocol (UTP)
1. The Mission: Securing the PayFi Ecosystem
The Unified Trust Protocol (UTP) is an open-source security framework designed to solve the two biggest barriers to mainstream Web3 adoption: Sybil attacks and identity fraud. Currently, Solana’s B2C and PayFi (Payment Finance) platforms lose millions in liquidity and user trust to bot-farming and "catfishing". UTP provides a privacy-preserving "Proof-of-Personhood" (PoP) gateway that allows any developer to verify real human users without touching or storing sensitive personal data (PII).
2. The Solution: A Triple-Layer Verification SDK
UTP replaces traditional, friction-heavy KYC with a seamless, developer-friendly SDK:
•	Layer 1: ZK-Email Validation: Utilizing Zero-Knowledge proofs (Circom/SnarkJS) to verify domain-specific email legitimacy via DKIM signatures, ensuring "one email = one account" without compromising user privacy.
•	Layer 2: Biometric Liveness: A mobile-first integration via the Solana Mobile Stack (SMS) that performs real-time human verification on-device.
•	Layer 3: Burn-to-Validate (B2V): A deflationary utility model where users burn tokens to mint an immutable "Trust-Hash," ensuring every verified user has "skin in the game."
3. Strategic Roadmap (The 2026 Vision)
We are executing a three-phase expansion to maximize ecosystem impact:
•	Phase 1 (Current Focus): Launch of the Identity & Safety Layer SDK for open-source use.
•	Phase 2: Development of the Reputation & Credit Layer for on-chain solvency proofs (DeFi/RWA track).
•	Phase 3: Transition to the DePIN Infrastructure Layer for verifiable physical node data.
4. Why Solana?
The PayFi revolution requires T+0 settlement and sub-second latency. Only Solana's high-speed architecture can support real-time ZK-verification and biometric signing at scale, making UTP a uniquely Solana-centric public good.
5. Funding Requirement & Team
•	Request: $15,000 USDC (Phase 1 POC).
•	The Team: Developed by Eons Soft Tech, a premier Ahmedabad-based dev agency with a proven track record of shipping complex enterprise software and blockchain solutions.

Strategic Guide for the Client
•	The "Public Good" Angle: Ensure the client understands that the Foundation's primary goal is to fund things that other developers can re-use. By making the SDK open-source, we meet this "Public Good" requirement perfectly.
•	Milestone-Based Payouts: Remind the client that funding is released only upon reaching measurable goals, such as completing the ZK-circuit design or the Devnet launch.
